  </p><p><span m=''21460''>PROFESSOR: OK. Let''s start. So we are back to calculating
  partition functions for Ising</span> <span m=''33520''>models. So again some in
  general hypercubic lattice where you have variables sigma i being</span> <span m=''44370''>minus
  plus 1 at each side with a tendency to be parallel. And our task is to calculate</span>
  <span m=''52550''>the partition function which for n sides amounts to summing over
  2 to the n binary configurations</span> <span m=''62050''>of a weight that favors
  near-neighbors to be in the same state with a strength K.</span> </p><p><span m=''70970''>OK.
  So the procedure that we are going to follow is this high temperature expansion,</span>
  <span m=''79408''>that is writing this as hyperbolic cosine of k 1 plus t standing
  for tan K sigma i,</span> <span m=''93219''>sigma j. And then as we discussed, actually
  this i would have to write as a product over</span> <span m=''106289''>all bonds.
  And then essentially to each bond on this lattice I would have to either assign</span>
  <span m=''119299''>1 or t sigma i, sigma j. Binary choice now moves to bonds.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''126590''>And then we saw that in order to make sure that following
  the summation over sigma these</span> <span m=''135790''>factors survived we have
  to make sure that we construct graphs where out of each side</span> <span m=''142209''>go
  out an even number of bonds. And we rewrote the whole thing as 2 to the n, cos K
  to the</span> <span m=''150230''>number of bonds, which for a hypercubic lattice
  is dn. And then we had a sum over graphs where</span> <span m=''160550''>we had
  an even number of bonds per side. And the contribution of the graph was basically</span>
  <span m=''175269''>t to the power of the number of bonds.</span> </p><p><span m=''184019''>So
  I''m going to call this sum over here s. After all, the interesting part of the
  problem</span> <span m=''195959''>is captured in this factor s, these 2 to the n
  cos K to the power of dn are perfectly well-behaved</span> <span m=''202390''>analytical
  functions. We are looking for something that is singular. So this s I can either
  pick</span> <span m=''211430''>one from all of the factors-- so to the lowest order
  in t I would have to do to one. And</span> <span m=''218879''>then we saw that the
  next order correction would be something like a square, would be</span> <span m=''224310''>this
  t to the 4th. And then objects that are more complicated versions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''231140''>And I can write all of those as a sum over kind of graphs that I can
  draw on the lattice</span> <span m=''242129''>by going around and making a loop.
  But then I will have graphs that will be composed of</span> <span m=''250400''>two
  loops, for example, that are disconnected. Since this can be translated all over
  the</span> <span m=''258620''>place this would have a factor of n for a lattice
  that is large for getting side effects</span> <span m=''264940''>and edge effects.
  This would have a contribution once I slide these two with respect to each</span>
  <span m=''270680''>other. That is, of the order of n squared. And then I would have
  things that would three</span> <span m=''276560''>loops and so forth.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''281449''>Now based on what we have seen before it is very tempting to somehow
  exponentiate this</span> <span m=''292120''>sum and write it as exponential of the
  sum over objects that have a single loop. And</span> <span m=''305030''>I will call
  this new sum actually s prime for reasons to become apparent because if</span> <span
  m=''315879''>I start to expand this exponential, what do I get?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''319930''>I will certainly start to get 1, then I will have the sum over single
  loop graphs plus</span> <span m=''327000''>one half whatever is in the exponent
  over here squared, 1 over 3 factorial whatever</span> <span m=''336840''>is in the
  exponent, which is this sum cubed, and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m=''344620''>And
  if I were to expand this thing that is something squared, I will uncertainty get</span>
  <span m=''352909''>terms in it that would correspond to two of the terms in the
  sum. Here I would get things</span> <span m=''359639''>that would correspond to
  three of the terms in the sum. And the communitorial factors</span> <span m=''365300''>would
  certainly work out to get rid of the 2 and the 6, depending on-- let''s say I have</span>
  <span m=''372441''>loop a, b, or c, I could pick a from the first sum here, b from
  the second, c from the third</span> <span m=''379759''>or any permutation thereafter
  that would amount to c. I would have a factor of c abc.</span> </p><p><span m=''385759''>But
  s definitely is not equal to s prime because immediately we see that once I square
  this</span> <span m=''396319''>term a plus b squared, in addition to a squared ab
  I will also get a squared and b squared,</span> <span m=''404880''>which corresponds
  to objects such as this. One half of the same graph repeated twice.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''420640''>Right? It is the a squared term that is appearing in this sum. And
  this clearly has no analog</span> <span m=''428840''>here in my sum s. I emphasize
  that in the sum s each bond can occur either zero or one</span> <span m=''439449''>time.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''440580''>Whereas if I exponentiate this you can see that s prime
  certainly contains things that</span> <span m=''448750''>potentially are repeated
  twice. As I go further I could have multiple times. Also when I square</span> <span
  m=''456400''>this term I could potentially get 1 factor from 1, another factor,
  which is also a loop</span> <span m=''468039''>from the second term, the second
  in this product of two brackets, which once I multiply them</span> <span m=''475670''>happen
  to overlap and share something. OK? All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''485580''>So
  very roughly and hand-wavingly, the thing is that s has loops that avoid each other,</span>
  <span m=''499740''>don''t intersect. Whereas s prime has loops that intersect. So
  very naively s is sum over,</span> <span m=''510069''>if you like, a gas of non-intersecting
  loops. Whereas s prime is a sum over gas of what</span> <span m=''530620''>I could
  call phantom loops. They''re kind of like ghosts. They can go through each other.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''539470''>OK? All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''543980''>So that''s
  one of a number of problems. Now in this lecture we are going to ignore this</span>
  <span m=''554320''>difference between s and s prime and calculate s prime, which
  therefore we will not be doing</span> <span m=''560850''>the right job. And this
  is one example of where I''m not doing the right job. And as</span> <span m=''566541''>I
  go through the calculation you may want to figure out also other places where I
  don''t</span> <span m=''572290''>know correctly reproduce the sum s in order to
  ultimately be able to make a calculation</span> <span m=''578000''>and see what
  it comes to.</span> </p><p><span m=''579880''>Now next lecture we will try to correct
  all of those errors, so you better keep track</span> <span m=''585910''>of all of
  those errors, make sure that I am doing everything right. Seems good-- all right.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''602260''>So let''s go and take a look at this s prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''610340''>So s prime, actually, log of s prime is a sum over graphs that I can
  draw on the lattice.</span> </p><p><span m=''628570''>And since I could exponentiate
  that, there was no problem in the exponentiation involved</span> <span m=''635350''>over
  here. Essentially I have to, for calculating the log, just calculate these singly
  connected</span> <span m=''643470''>loops. And you can see that that will work out
  fine as far as extensivity is concerned</span> <span m=''648510''>because I could
  translate each one of these figures of the loops over the lattice and</span> <span
  m=''653250''>get the factors of n. So this is clearly something that is OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''660150''>Now since I''m already making this mistake of forgetting
  about the intersections between</span> <span m=''666990''>loops I''m going to make
  another assumption that is in this sum of single loops. I already</span> <span m=''680810''>include
  things where the single loop is allowed to intersect itself. For example, I''m going</span>
  <span m=''703260''>to allow as a single loop entity something that is like this
  where this particular bond</span> <span m=''714180''>will give a factor of t squared.
  Clearly I should not include this in the correct sum.</span> </p><p><span m=''722700''>But
  since I''m ignoring intersections among the different groups and I''m making it
  phantom,</span> <span m=''729180''>let''s make it also phantom with respect to itself,
  allow it to intersect itself [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p><p><span m=''735010''>It''s
  in the same spirit of the mistake that we are going to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''742930''>So
  now what do we have? We can write that log of s prime is this sum over loops of
  length</span> <span m=''757420''>l and then multiply it by t to the l. So basically
  I say that I can draw loops, let''s say of</span> <span m=''769530''>size four,
  loops of size six. Each one of them I have to multiply by t to the l. Of</span>
  <span m=''778310''>course, I have to multiply with the number of loops of length
  l. OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''793980''>And this I''m going to write slightly differently.
  So I''m going to say that log of s prime is</span> <span m=''803380''>sum over this
  length of the loop. All the loops of length l are going to contribute</span> <span
  m=''811270''>a factor of t to the l. And I''m going to count the loops of length
  l that start and end at</span> <span m=''824500''>the origin. And I''ll give that
  a symbol wl00.</span> </p><p><span m=''829960''>Actually, very soon I will introduce
  a generalization of this. So let me write the definition. I</span> <span m=''842480''>define
  a matrix that is indexed by two side of the lattice and counts the number of walks</span>
  <span m=''853430''>that I can have from one to the other, from i to j in l steps.
  So this is number of walks</span> <span m=''866010''>of length l from i to j. OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''878260''>So what am I doing here? Since I am looking at single
  loop objects, I want to sum over,</span> <span m=''894570''>let''s say, all terms
  that contribute, in this case t to the 4. It''s obvious because it''s</span> <span
  m=''901300''>really just one shape. It''s a square, but this square I could have
  started at anywhere</span> <span m=''906920''>on the lattice. And this slight factor,
  which captures the extensivity, I''ll take outside</span> <span m=''917240''>because
  I expect this log of s to be extensive. It should be proportional to n. So one part</span>
  <span m=''923640''>of it is essentially where I start to draw this loop. So I say
  that I always start with</span> <span m=''929620''>the loops that I have at point
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''936040''>Then I want to come back to myself. So I
  indicate that the end point should also be zero. And</span> <span m=''944310''>if
  I want to get a term here, this is a term that is t to the fourth. I need to know
  how</span> <span m=''949870''>many of such blocks I have. Yes?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''952720''>AUDIENCE: Are you allowing the loop to intersect itself in this case
  or not?</span> </p><p><span m=''957760''>PROFESSOR: In this case, yes. I will also,
  when I''m calculating anything to do with s</span> <span m=''963001''>prime I allow
  intersection. So if you are asking whether I''m allowing something like</span> <span
  m=''967880''>this, the answer is yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''969200''>AUDIENCE:
  OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''970200''>PROFESSOR: Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m=''971200''>AUDIENCE:
  And are we assuming an infinitely large system so that--</span> <span m=''975820''>PROFESSOR:
  Yes. That''s right. So that the edge effects, you don''t have to worry about.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''980110''>Or alternatively you can imagine that you have periodic
  boundary conditions. And with</span> <span m=''986090''>periodic boundary conditions
  we can still slide it all over the place. OK? But clearly</span> <span m=''992320''>then
  the maximal size of these loops, et cetera, will be determined potentially by the
  size</span> <span m=''997510''>of the lattice.</span> </p><p><span m=''1000490''>Now
  this is not entirely correct because there is an over-counting. This 1one square
  that</span> <span m=''1009510''>I have drawn over here, I could have started from
  this point, to this point, this point.</span> </p><p><span m=''1017010''>And essentially
  for something that has length l, I would have had l possible starting points.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1025769''>So in order to avoid the over-counting I have to divide
  by l. And in fact I could have started</span> <span m=''1034299''>walking along
  this direction, or alternatively I could have gone in the clockwise direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1042339''>So there''s two orientations to the walk that will take
  me from the origin back to the origin</span> <span m=''1048669''>in l steps.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1050080''>And not to do the over-counting, I have to divide by
  2l. Yes?</span> </p><p><span m=''1054440''>AUDIENCE: If we allow walking over ourselves
  is it always a degeneracy of 2l?</span> </p><p><span m=''1062620''>PROFESSOR: Yes.
  You can go and do the calculation to convince yourself that even for something</span>
  <span m=''1069009''>as convoluted as that, you can... is too.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1075420''>PROFESSOR: OK. So this is what we want to calculate. Well, it turns
  out that this entity</span> <span m=''1085700''>actually shows up somewhere else
  also. So let me tell you why I wanted to write a more</span> <span m=''1091929''>general
  thing. Another quantity that I can try to calculate is the spin-spin correlation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1099190''>I can pick spin zero here and say spin r here, some other
  location. And I want to calculate</span> <span m=''1109230''>what is the correlation
  between these two spins. OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''1115660''>So how do I have
  to do that for the Ising model? I have to essentially sum over all</span> <span
  m=''1122220''>configurations with an additional factor of sigma zero sigma r of
  this weight, e to the</span> <span m=''1131100''>k, sum over ij, sigma i, sigma
  j, appropriately normalized, of course, by the partition function.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1145920''>And I can make the same transformation that I have on the first line
  of these exponential</span> <span m=''1152320''>factors to write this as a sum over
  sigma i, I have sigma zero, sigma r, and then product</span> <span m=''1163360''>over
  all bonds of these factors of one plus t sigma i, sigma j.</span> </p><p><span m=''1168950''>The
  factors of 2 to the n cos K will cancel out between the numerator and the denominator.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1174860''>And basically I will get the same thing. Now of course
  the denominator is the partition</span> <span m=''1187789''>function. It is the
  sum s that we are after, but we can also, and we''ve seen this already</span> <span
  m=''1193980''>how to do this, express the sum in the numerator graphically. And
  the difference between the</span> <span m=''1200380''>numerator and the denominator
  is that I have an additional sigma sitting here, an additional</span> <span m=''1207120''>sigma
  sitting there, that if left by themselves will average out to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1215110''>So I need to connect them by paths that are composed of factors of
  t sigma sigma, originating</span> <span m=''1223629''>on one and ending on the other.
  Right? So in the same sense that what is appearing in</span> <span m=''1236970''>the
  denominator is a sum that involves these loops, the first term that appears in the</span>
  <span m=''1246840''>numerator is a path that connects zero to r through some combination
  of these factors</span> <span m=''1255510''>of t, and then I have to sum over all
  possible ways of doing that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1261230''>But then I could
  certainly have graphs that involves the same thing. And the loop, there</span> <span
  m=''1269629''>is nothing that is against that, or the same thing, and two loops,
  and so forth. And you</span> <span m=''1281100''>can see that as long as, and only
  as long as I treat these as phantom objects that can</span> <span m=''1289059''>pass
  through each other I can factor out this term and the rest of 1 plus 1, loop plus
  2</span> <span m=''1297240''>loop, is exactly what I have in the denominator.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1301309''>So we see that under the assumption of phantomness, if
  phantom then this becomes really just the</span> <span m=''1316350''>sum over all
  paths that go from 0 to r. And of course the contribution of each path is</span>
  <span m=''1328639''>how many factors of t I have. Right? So I have to have a sum
  over the length of this</span> <span m=''1340740''>path l. Paths of length l will
  contribute a factor of t to the l. But there are potentially</span> <span m=''1349320''>multiple
  ways to go from i0 to r in l steps.</span> </p><p><span m=''1354970''>How many ways?
  That''s precisely what I call this 0w of lr. Yes?</span> </p><p><span m=''1366840''>AUDIENCE:
  Why does a graph that goes from 0 to r in three different ways have [INAUDIBLE]?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1376000''>PROFESSOR: OK. So you want to have to go from 0 to r,
  you want to have a single path, and</span> <span m=''1385420''>then you want that
  path to do something like this?</span> </p><p><span m=''1389740''>AUDIENCE: Yeah.
  That doesn''t [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p><p><span m=''1392590''>PROFESSOR: That''s
  fine. If I ignore the phantomness condition this is the same as this multiplied</span>
  <span m=''1401990''>by this, which is a term that appears in the denominator and
  cancels out.</span> </p><p><span m=''1407980''>AUDIENCE: But you''re assuming that
  you have the phantom condition. So this is completely</span> <span m=''1415560''>normal.
  It doesn''t matter.</span> </p><p><span m=''1425800''>PROFESSOR: I''m not sure I
  understand your question. You say that even without the phantom</span> <span m=''1430480''>condition
  this graph exists.</span> </p><p><span m=''1432380''>AUDIENCE: With them phantom
  condition--</span> <span m=''1434320''>PROFESSOR: Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1435360''>AUDIENCE:
  --this graph is perfectly normal.</span> </p><p><span m=''1438220''>PROFESSOR: Even
  without the phantom condition this is an acceptable graph. Yeah. OK. Yeah?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1456400''>AUDIENCE: So what does phantomness mean? Why then we
  can simplify only a [INAUDIBLE]?</span> </p><p><span m=''1466160''>PROFESSOR: OK.
  Because let''s say I were to take this as a check and multiply it by the</span>
  <span m=''1479860''>denominator. The question is, would I generate a series that
  is in the numerator? OK? So</span> <span m=''1489070''>if I take this object that
  I have said is the answer, I have to multiply it by this</span> <span m=''1496369''>object.
  And make sure that it introduces correctly the numerator. The question is, when
  does</span> <span m=''1506389''>it? I mean, certainly when I multiply this by this,
  I will get the possibility of having</span> <span m=''1512619''>a graph such as
  this. And from here, I can have a loop such as this. And the two of them</span>
  <span m=''1519280''>would share a bond such as that. So in the real Ising model,
  that is not allowed. So</span> <span m=''1526540''>that''s the phantomness condition
  that allows me to factor these things. OK? All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''1543240''>So
  we see that if I have this quantity that I have written in red, then I can calculate</span>
  <span m=''1554019''>both correlation functions, as well as the free energy, log
  of the partition function</span> <span m=''1561679''>within this phantomness assumption.
  So the question is, can I calculate that? And the</span> <span m=''1570419''>answer
  is that calculating number of random walks is one of the most basic things that</span>
  <span m=''1576480''>one does in statistical physics, and easily accomplished as
  follows.</span> </p><p><span m=''1584380''>Basically, I say that, OK, let''s say
  that I start from 0, actually let''s do it 0 and</span> <span m=''1596460''>r, and
  let''s say that I have looked at all possible paths that have l steps and end up</span>
  <span m=''1610440''>over here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1613210''>So this is step
  one, step two, step number three. And the last one, step l, I have purposely</span>
  <span m=''1620779''>drawn as a dotted line. Maybe I will pull this point further
  down to emphasize that</span> <span m=''1628049''>this is the last one. This is
  l minus 1 is the previous one. So I can certainly state</span> <span m=''1636960''>that
  the number of walks from 0 to r in l steps.</span> </p><p><span m=''1649460''>Well,
  any walk that got to r in l steps, at the l minus one step had to be somewhere.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1659190''>OK? So what I do is I do a number of walks from 0 to
  r prime, I''ll call this point r</span> <span m=''1672870''>prime, in l minus one
  steps. And then times the number of ways, or number of walks from</span> <span m=''1688710''>r
  prime to r in one step. So before I reach my destination the previous step I had
  to</span> <span m=''1699909''>have been somewhere, I sum over all possible various
  places where that somewhere has to</span> <span m=''1706759''>be, and then I have
  to make sure that I can reach from that somewhere in one step to my</span> <span
  m=''1714980''>destination. That''s all that sum is, OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''1718919''>Now
  I can convert that to mathematics. This quantity is start from 0, take l steps,
  arrive</span> <span m=''1729080''>at r. By definition that''s the number. And what
  it says is that this should be a sum</span> <span m=''1738249''>over r pi, start
  from 0, take l minus 1 steps, arrive at r prime. Start from r prime, take</span>
  <span m=''1751509''>one step, arrive at your destination r, sum over r prime. OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1763289''>Now these are n by n matrices that are labeled by l.
  Right? So these, being n by n matrices,</span> <span m=''1774659''>this summation
  over r prime is clearly a matrix multiplication. So what that says is that</span>
  <span m=''1783909''>summing over r prime tells you that that is w 1, w of l minus
  1, 0. And that is true for</span> <span m=''1794119''>any pair of elements, starting
  and final points. So basically, quite generically, we see that</span> <span m=''1800840''>w,
  the matrix that corresponds to the count for l steps, is obtained from the matrix
  that</span> <span m=''1810919''>corresponds to the count for one step multiplying
  that of l minus 1 steps. And clearly I can</span> <span m=''1820299''>keep going.
  wl minus 1, I can write as w 1, w of l minus 2, and so forth.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1830820''>And ultimately the answer is none other than the entity that corresponds
  to one step raised</span> <span m=''1837549''>to the l power. And just to make things
  easier on my writing, I will indicate this as t to</span> <span m=''1846570''>the
  l where t stands for this matrix for one set. OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''1860950''>This
  condition over here that I said in words that allows me to write this in this nice</span>
  <span m=''1868610''>matrix form is called the Markovian condition. The kind of walks
  that I have been telling</span> <span m=''1880330''>you our Markovian in the sense
  that they only they depend on where you came from at the</span> <span m=''1887520''>last
  step. They don''t have memory of where you had been before.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1893989''>And that''s what enables us to do this. And that''s why I had to do
  the phantom condition</span> <span m=''1901070''>because if I really wanted to say
  that something like this has to be excluded, then the walk</span> <span m=''1909060''>must
  keep memory of every place that it had been before.</span> </p><p><span m=''1913660''>Right?
  And then it would be non-Markovian.</span> </p><p><span m=''1916500''>Then I wouldn''t
  have been able to do this nice calculation. That''s why I had to do this</span>
  <span m=''1924240''>phantomness assumption so that I forgot the memory of where
  my walk was previously. OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''1935840''>Now... Yeah? Question?
  No?</span> </p><p><span m=''1941520''>So this matrix, where you can go in one step,
  is really the matrix of who is connected to</span> <span m=''1953860''>whom. Right?
  So this tells you the connectivity. So for example, if I''m dealing with a 2D square</span>
  <span m=''1968590''>lattice the sides on my lattice are labeled by x and y. And
  I can ask, where can I go</span> <span m=''1982869''>in one step if I start from
  x and y? And the answer is that either x stays the same and</span> <span m=''1993789''>why
  y shifts by one, or y stays the same and x shifts by one. These are the four non-zero</span>
  <span m=''2011359''>elements of the matrix that allows you to go on the square lattice
  either up, down,</span> <span m=''2018440''>right, or left. And the corresponding
  things that you would have for the cube or whatever</span> <span m=''2023480''>lattice.
  OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''2027380''>Now you look at this and you can see that
  what I have imposed clearly is such that for</span> <span m=''2035070''>a lattice
  where every side looks like every equivalent side this is really a function</span>
  <span m=''2044639''>only of the separation between the two points. It''s an n by
  n matrix. It has n squared elements,</span> <span m=''2055760''>but the elements
  really are essentially one column that gets shifted as you go further</span> <span
  m=''2061199''>and further down in a very specific way.</span> </p><p><span m=''2066760''>And
  whenever you have a matrix such as this translational symmetry implies that you
  can</span> <span m=''2075520''>diagonalize it by Fourier transformation. And what
  do I mean by that? This is, I can</span> <span m=''2090630''>define a vector q such
  that it''s various components are things like e to the i q dot r in whatever</span>
  <span m=''2103350''>dimension. Let''s normalize it by square root of n. And I should
  be sure that that is an</span> <span m=''2110380''>eigenvector.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2112560''>So basically my statement is that if I take the matrix t, act on q,
  then I should get</span> <span m=''2123120''>some eigenvalue in the vector back.
  And let''s check that for the case of the 2D system.</span> </p><p><span m=''2134270''>So
  for the 2D system, if I say that x y t qx qy, what is it? Well, that is x y t x
  prime,</span> <span m=''2153780''>y prime, the entity that I have calculated here,
  x prime, y prime qx, qy. And of course,</span> <span m=''2162770''>I have a sum
  over x prime and y prime. That''s the matrix product.</span> </p><p><span m=''2167870''>And
  so again, remember this entity is simply e to the i qx x prime plus qy y prime,
  divided</span> <span m=''2181650''>by square root of n. And because this is a set
  of delta functions, what does it do? It</span> <span m=''2191080''>basically sets
  x prime either to x plus 1, or x minus 1, y prime either to y or y minus</span>
  <span m=''2197010''>1, y minus 1. You can see that you always get back your e to
  the i qx x plus qy y with</span> <span m=''2206720''>a factor of root n.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2209330''>So essentially that by the delta functions just changes
  the x primes to x at the cost</span> <span m=''2216290''>of the different shifts
  that you have to do over there, which means that you will get</span> <span m=''2220750''>a
  factor of e to the i qx, e to the minus iqx, with qy not changing, or e to the i
  qy,</span> <span m=''2228490''>and e to the minus i qy with the x component not
  changing. So this is the standard thing</span> <span m=''2236610''>that you have
  seen, is none other than 2 cosine of qx, plus cosine of qy. And so we can see</span>
  <span m=''2247500''>that quite generally in the d-dimensional hypercube, my t of
  q is going to be the sum</span> <span m=''2262440''>over all d components of these
  factors of cosine of q alpha. And that''s about it, OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''2281270''>So
  why did I bother to this diagonalization? The answer is that that now allows me
  to calculate</span> <span m=''2291090''>everything that I want. So, for example,
  I know that this quantity that I''m interested</span> <span m=''2301090''>in, sigma
  0 sigma r, is going to be a sum over l, t to the l, then 0. wl is t to the</span>
  <span m=''2318500''>l times r. Right?</span> </p><p><span m=''2326030''>Now this
  small t, I can take inside here and do it like this. And if I want, I can write</span>
  <span m=''2336680''>this as the 0 r component of a sum over l tt raised to the power
  of l. So it''s a new</span> <span m=''2349620''>matrix, which is essentially sum
  over l, small t times this connectivity matrix to the l-th</span> <span m=''2357990''>power.
  This is a geometric series. We can immediately do the geometric series. The Answer</span>
  <span m=''2364670''>is 0, 1 over 1 minus tt going all the way to r. OK? And the
  reason I did this diagonalization</span> <span m=''2382790''>is so that I can calculate
  this matrix element, because I don''t really want to invert a whole</span> <span
  m=''2391440''>matrix, but I can certainly invert the matrix when it is in the diagonal
  basis because all</span> <span m=''2398120''>I have to do is to invert pure numbers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2402620''>So what is done is to go to the Fourier basis and rotate
  to the Fourier basis calculate this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2417120''>It is diagonal
  in this basis. I have q r. And so what is that? These are these</span> <span m=''2427660''>exponentials
  here evaluated at the origin, so it''s just 1 over root n. This is 1 over</span>
  <span m=''2435281''>root n. This is e to the i q dot r over root n. This is just
  the eigenvalue that I have</span> <span m=''2446440''>calculated over here. So this
  entity is none other than a sum over q, e to the i q dot</span> <span m=''2461860''>r
  divided by n, two factors of square root of n. 1 over 1 minus t-- well, actually
  let''s</span> <span m=''2471190''>write it 2t-- sum over alpha cosine of q alpha.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2483620''>And then of course I''m interested in big systems. I
  replace the sum over q with an integral</span> <span m=''2490710''>over q, 2 pi
  to the d density of states. In going from there to there, there''s a factor</span>
  <span m=''2498630''>of volume, the way that I have set the unit of length in my
  system. The volume is actually</span> <span m=''2504590''>the number of particles
  that I have. So that factor of n disappears. And all I need to</span> <span m=''2512340''>do
  is evaluate this factor of 1 minus 2t sum over alpha cosine of q alpha integrated
  over</span> <span m=''2520690''>q Fourier transformed. OK? Yes?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2529040''>AUDIENCE: So I notice that you have a sum over q, but then you also
  have a sum alpha</span> <span m=''2534380''>q alpha.</span> </p><p><span m=''2535900''>PROFESSOR:
  Right.</span> </p><p><span m=''2536400''>AUDIENCE: Is there a relationship between
  the q and the q alpha or not?</span> </p><p><span m=''2540300''>PROFESSOR: OK. So
  that goes back here. So when I had two dimensions, I had qx and qy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2546520''>Right? And so I labeled, rather than x and y, with q1 and q2. So the
  index alpha is just</span> <span m=''2555250''>a number of spatial dimensions. If
  you like, this is also dq1, dq2, dqd.</span> </p><p><span m=''2566040''>AUDIENCE:
  OK. [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p><p><span m=''2573700''>PROFESSOR: OK. All right. So
  we are down here. Let''s proceed. So what is going to happen?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2591760''>So suppose I''m picking two sides, 0 and r, let''s say both along
  the x direction, some</span> <span m=''2599410''>particular distance apart. Let''s
  say seven, eight apart. So in order to evaluate this</span> <span m=''2610590''>I
  would have an integral if this is the x direction of something like e to the iq
  x</span> <span m=''2616821''>times r. Now when I integrate over qx the integral
  of e to the iqx times r would go</span> <span m=''2626190''>to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2628820''>The only way that it won''t go to 0 is from the expansion of what
  is in the denominator.</span> </p><p><span m=''2634880''>I should bring on enough
  factors of e to the minus iqx, which certainly exist in these</span> <span m=''2640720''>cosine
  factors, to get rid of that. So essentially, the mathematical procedure that is
  over here</span> <span m=''2649440''>is to bring in sufficient factors of e to the
  minus i q dot r to eliminate that. And</span> <span m=''2659270''>the number of
  ways that you are going to do that is precisely another way of capturing</span>
  <span m=''2664850''>this entity, which means that clearly if I''m looking at something
  like this, and I mean</span> <span m=''2675130''>the limit that t goes to be very,
  very small so that the lowest order in t contributes,</span> <span m=''2681760''>the
  lowest order t would be the shortest path that joins these two points.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2688250''>So it is like connecting these two points with a string that is very
  tight. So that</span> <span m=''2695800''>what I am saying is that the limit as
  t goes to 0 of something like sigma 0, sigma r is</span> <span m=''2703660''>going
  to be identical to t to the minimum distance between 0 and r. Actually, I should</span>
  <span m=''2718040''>say proportional, is in fact more correct. Because there could
  be multiple shortest paths</span> <span m=''2725790''>that go between two points.
  OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''2731540''>Now let''s make sense. There''s kind of an
  exponential. Essentially I start with the high temperature</span> <span m=''2740440''>limit
  where the two things don''t know anything about each other. So sigma 0, sigma r
  is going</span> <span m=''2744950''>to be 0. So anything that is beyond 0 has to
  come from somewhere in which the information</span> <span m=''2752470''>about the
  state of the site was conveyed all the way over here. And it is done through</span>
  <span m=''2759410''>passing one bond at a time. And in some sense, the fidelity
  of each one of those transformations</span> <span m=''2765980''>is proportional
  to t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2769940''>Now as t becomes larger you are going to
  be willing to pay the costs of paths that go</span> <span m=''2779570''>from 0 to
  r in a slightly more disordered way. So your string that was tight becomes</span>
  <span m=''2788150''>kind of loose and floppy. And why does that become the case?
  Because now although these</span> <span m=''2795990''>paths are longer and carry
  more factors of this t that is small, there are just so many</span> <span m=''2802670''>of
  them that the entropy, the number of these paths starts to dominate. OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2810470''>So very roughly you can state the competition between
  them as follows, that the contribution</span> <span m=''2819730''>of the path of
  length l, decays like t to the l, but the number of paths roughly grows</span> <span
  m=''2829260''>like 2d to the power of l. And since we have this phantomness character,
  if I am sitting</span> <span m=''2836140''>at a particular site, I can go up, down,
  right, left. So at each step I have in two dimensions</span> <span m=''2844210''>a
  choice of four, in three dimensions a choice of six, in d-dimensions a choice of
  2d.</span> </p><p><span m=''2852270''>So you can see that this is exponentially
  small, this is exponentially large. So they</span> <span m=''2857430''>kind of balance
  each other. And the balance is something like e to the minus l over some</span>
  <span m=''2864730''>typical l that we''ll contribute. And clearly the typical l
  is going to be finite as long</span> <span m=''2872010''>as 2dt is less than 1.
  So you can see that something strange has to happen at the value</span> <span m=''2882130''>where
  tc is such that 2dtc is equal to 1.</span> </p><p><span m=''2889060''>At that point
  the cost of making your paths longer is more than made up by increasing</span> <span
  m=''2898380''>the number of paths that you can have, the entropy starts to be. And
  you can see that</span> <span m=''2905080''>precisely that condition tells me whether
  or not this integral exists, right? Because</span> <span m=''2914920''>one point
  of this integral where the integrand is largest is when q goes to 0. And you can</span>
  <span m=''2922600''>see that as q goes to 0, the value in the denominator is 1 minus
  2td. So there is precisely</span> <span m=''2931330''>a pole when this condition
  takes place.</span> </p><p><span m=''2936290''>And if I''m interested in seeing
  what is happening when I''m in the vicinity of that transition,</span> <span m=''2944910''>right
  before these paths become very large, what I can do is I can start exploring what</span>
  <span m=''2952540''>is happening in the vicinity of that pole. So 1 minus 2d, sum
  over alpha cosine of q</span> <span m=''2961570''>alpha, how does it behave?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2965400''>Each cosine I can start expanding around its q going
  to 0 as 1 minus q squared over 2,</span> <span m=''2972050''>so you can see that
  this is going to be 1 minus 2td. And then I would have plus t q</span> <span m=''2983180''>squared,
  because I will have q1 squared plus q2 squared plus qd. So this q squared is the</span>
  <span m=''2988330''>sum of all the q''s.</span> </p><p><span m=''2990600''>And then
  I do have higher order terms. Order of q to fourth, and so forth. OK? So if I''m</span>
  <span m=''3001730''>looking in the vicinity of t going to tc, this is roughly tc
  q squared. This is something</span> <span m=''3012340''>that goes to 0 and once
  I factor out the tc, I can define a length squared in this fashion,</span> <span
  m=''3022840''>inverse length squared. OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''3024230''>PROFESSOR:
  You can see that this inverse length squared is going to be 1 over tc 1 minus 2d,</span>
  <span m=''3037240''>which is 1 over tc times t. So you can see that this is none
  other than tc minus t. And</span> <span m=''3051930''>if I''m looking at the vicinity
  of that point, I find that the correlation between sigma</span> <span m=''3056640''>0
  sigma r is approximately the integral ddq 2 pi to the d, Fourier transform of the
  denominator</span> <span m=''3067760''>that I said is approximately 1 over tc times
  q squared plus z to the minus 2.</span> </p><p><span m=''3078650''>We''ve seen this
  before. You evaluated this Fourier transform when you were doing Landau-Ginzburg.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3087240''>So this is something that grows when you are looking
  at distances that are much</span> <span m=''3097740''>less than this correlation
  length as the Coulomb power law. When you are looking at distances</span> <span
  m=''3106480''>that are much larger than the correlation event, you get the exponential
  decay with</span> <span m=''3114260''>this r to the d minus 1 over 2 factor.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3122990''>So what we find is that the correlation of these phantom
  loops is precisely the correlation</span> <span m=''3132300''>that we had seen for
  the Gaussian model, in fact. It has a correlation length that diverges</span> <span
  m=''3141610''>in precisely the same way that we had seen for the Gaussian model
  with the square root</span> <span m=''3148640''>singularity. So this is our usual
  mu equals 1/2 type of behavior that we''ve seen.</span> </p><p><span m=''3157870''>And
  somehow, by all of these routes, we have reproduced some property of the Gaussian
  model.</span> </p><p><span m=''3170640''>In fact, it''s a little bit more than that,
  because we can go back and look at what we</span> <span m=''3179000''>had here for
  the free energy. So let''s erase the things that pertain to the correlation</span>
  <span m=''3186860''>length and correlations, and focus on the calculation that we
  kind of left in the middle</span> <span m=''3203520''>over here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3206040''>So what do we have? We have that log of S prime, the intensive part,
  is a sum over the</span> <span m=''3217430''>lengths of these loops that start and
  end at the origin. And the contribution of a loop</span> <span m=''3226920''>of
  length l is small t to the l.</span> </p><p><span m=''3230840''>And since w of l
  is the connectivity matrix to the l power, it''s really like looking at</span> <span
  m=''3237840''>the matrix element of this entity. And of course, there is this degeneracy
  factor of</span> <span m=''3244990''>2l. And I can write this as 1/2 sum over l.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3251010''>Well, let''s do it this way-- the 0-th, 0-th element
  of sum over l dt to the l over l.</span> </p><p><span m=''3269460''>And what is
  this? This is, in fact, the series expansion of minus log of 1 minus dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3288090''>So I can, again, go to the Fourier basis, write this
  as minus 1/2 sum over q0, 0 q log</span> <span m=''3306340''>of 1 minus t the eigenvalue
  t of q, and then q0. Each one of these is just the factor of</span> <span m=''3317160''>1
  over square root of n. The sum over q goes over to n integral over q. So this simply</span>
  <span m=''3330120''>becomes minus 1/2 integral over q 2 pi to the d log of 1 minus
  t, this sum over alpha</span> <span m=''3345880''>cosine of q alpha [INAUDIBLE]
  2 that we had over here.</span> </p><p><span m=''3355790''>And again, if I go to
  this limit where I am close to tc, the critical value of this t,</span> <span m=''3365200''>and
  focus on the behavior as q goes to 0, this is going to be something that has this</span>
  <span m=''3370910''>q squared plus c to the minus 2 type of singularity. And again,
  this is a kind of integral that</span> <span m=''3378380''>we saw in connection
  with the Gaussian model. And we know the kind of singularities it gives.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3390380''>But why did we end up with the Gaussian model? Let''s
  work backward. That is, typically, when</span> <span m=''3402230''>we are doing
  some kind of a partition function of a Gaussian model-- let''s say we have some</span>
  <span m=''3410010''>integral over some variables phi i.</span> </p><p><span m=''3414610''>Let''s
  say we put them on the sides of a lattice. And we have e to the minus phi i some
  matrix</span> <span m=''3421570''>m ij phi j over 2 sum over i and j implicit over
  there. What was the answer? Then the</span> <span m=''3430360''>answer was typically
  proportional to 1 over the determinant of this matrix to the 1/2,</span> <span m=''3438480''>which,
  if I exponentiated, would be exponential of minus 1/2 logarithm of the determinant</span>
  <span m=''3449620''>of this matrix.</span> </p><p><span m=''3456760''>So that''s
  the general result. And we see the result for our log of S prime is, indeed,</span>
  <span m=''3463720''>the form of 1/2 minus 1/2 of the log of something. And indeed,
  this sum over q corresponds to</span> <span m=''3476190''>summing over the different
  eigenvalues. And if I were to express det m in terms of the</span> <span m=''3482940''>product
  of its eigenvalues, it would be precisely that.</span> </p><p><span m=''3488180''>So
  you can see that actually, what we have calculated by comparison of these two things</span>
  <span m=''3496530''>corresponds to a matrix m ij, which is delta ij minus t times
  this single step connectivity</span> <span m=''3512540''>matrix that I had before.
  So indeed, the partition function that I calculated, that I called</span> <span
  m=''3522450''>Z prime or S prime, corresponds to doing the following-- doing an
  integral over phi i''s</span> <span m=''3535790''>from the delta ij. Essentially
  for each phi i, I would have a factor of minus phi i squared</span> <span m=''3543110''>over
  2. So essentially, I have to do this. And then from here, once it''s exponentiated,</span>
  <span m=''3553600''>I will get a factor of e to the sum over ij this t phi i phi
  j.</span> </p><p><span m=''3570980''>So you can see that I started calculating Ising
  variables on this lattice. The result</span> <span m=''3583490''>that I calculated
  for these phantom walks is actually identical if I had to replace</span> <span m=''3589100''>the
  Ising variables with just quantities that I integrate all over the place, provided
  that</span> <span m=''3595160''>I weigh them with this factor. So really, the difference
  between the Ising and what</span> <span m=''3602600''>I have done here can be captured
  by putting a weight for the indirect integration per</span> <span m=''3610720''>site.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3612940''>So if I really want to do Ising, the weight that I want
  to do for the Ising-- let''s do</span> <span m=''3621000''>it this way-- for phi
  has to have a delta function at minus 1 and a delta function at</span> <span m=''3629040''>plus
  1. Rather than doing that, I have calculated a w that corresponds to the Gaussian
  where</span> <span m=''3641670''>the weight for each phi is basically a Gaussian
  weight.</span> </p><p><span m=''3650420''>And if I really wanted to do the Landau-Ginzburg,</span>
  <span m=''3655160''>all I would need to do is to add here a phi to the 4th.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3661720''>The problem with this Gaussian-- the phantom system that
  I have-- is the same problem that</span> <span m=''3669560''>we had with the Gaussian
  model. It only gives me one side of the phase transition. Because</span> <span m=''3676771''>you
  see that I did all of these calculations. All of these calculations were consistent,</span>
  <span m=''3683220''>as long as I was dealing with t that was less than tc.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3690980''>Once I go to t that is greater than tc, then this denominator
  that I had became negative.</span> </p><p><span m=''3697520''>It just doesn''t make
  sense. Correlations negative don''t make sense. The log, the argument that</span>
  <span m=''3703080''>I have to calculate here, if t is below-- is larger than 1 over
  2d, then it doesn''t</span> <span m=''3710380''>make sense.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3713440''>And of course, the reason the whole theory doesn''t make sense is
  kind of related to the</span> <span m=''3718230''>instability that we have in the
  Gaussian model. Essentially, in the Gaussian model also, when</span> <span m=''3724200''>t
  becomes large enough, this phi squared is not enough to remove the instability that</span>
  <span m=''3731290''>you have for the largest eigenvalue. Physically, what that means
  is that we started with this</span> <span m=''3738940''>taut string. And as we approached
  the transition, the string became more flexible.</span> </p><p><span m=''3746320''>And
  in principle, what this instability is telling me is that you go below the transition</span>
  <span m=''3753580''>of t greater than tc, and the string becomes something that
  can go over and over itself</span> <span m=''3763340''>as many times, and gain entropy
  further and further. So it will keep going forever. There</span> <span m=''3769491''>is
  nothing to stop it.</span> </p><p><span m=''3771950''>So the phantomness condition,
  the cost that you pay for it, is that once you go beyond</span> <span m=''3777960''>the
  transition, you essentially overwhelm yourself. There''s just so much that is going</span>
  <span m=''3783760''>on. There is nothing that you can do. So that''s the story.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3797080''>Now, let''s try to finally understand some of the things
  that we had before, like this</span> <span m=''3807440''>other critical dimension
  of 4. Where did it come from, et cetera? You are now in the position</span> <span
  m=''3813210''>to do things and understand things.</span> </p><p><span m=''3816970''>First
  thing to note is, let''s try to understand what this exponent mu equal to 1/2 means.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3832760''>So we said that if I think about having information about
  my site at the origin, that has to propagate</span> <span m=''3847050''>so that
  further and further neighbors start to know what the information was at site sigma</span>
  <span m=''3855100''>0-- that that information can come through these paths that
  fluctuate, go different distances,</span> <span m=''3866029''>and eventually, let''s
  say, reach a boundary that is at size r. As we said, the contribution</span> <span
  m=''3878380''>of each path decays exponentially, but the number of paths grows exponentially.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3889580''>And so for a particular t that is smaller than the critical
  value, I can roughly say</span> <span m=''3897540''>that this falls off like this,
  so that there is a characteristic length, l bar. This characteristic</span> <span
  m=''3906800''>l bar is going to be minus 1 over log of 2dt. And 2dt I can write
  as 2d tc plus t minus</span> <span m=''3922830''>tc. 2 d tc is, by construction,
  1. So this is minus 1 over log of 1 plus something like</span> <span m=''3938070''>2d,
  which is 1 over t minus tc, t minus tc over tc.</span> </p><p><span m=''3947320''>Now,
  log of 1 plus a small number-- so if my t goes and approaches tc-- this log will</span>
  <span m=''3956160''>behave like what I have over here. So you can see that this
  diverges as t minus tc to</span> <span m=''3965070''>the minus 1 power. I want it,
  I guess, to be correct-- tc minus t, because t is less</span> <span m=''3977980''>than
  tc. But the point is that the divergence is linear. As I approach tc, the length
  of</span> <span m=''3987870''>these paths will grow inversely to how close I am.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3996830''>Now what are these paths? I start from the origin, and
  I randomly take steps. And I''ve</span> <span m=''4005860''>said that the typical
  steps that I will get will roughly have length l bar.</span> </p><p><span m=''4014490''>How
  far have these paths carried the information? These are random walks, so the distance
  over</span> <span m=''4022200''>which they have managed to carry the information,
  c, is going to be like the square root of</span> <span m=''4031450''>the length
  of these walks. And since the length of the walks grows like t minus tc, this goes</span>
  <span m=''4039510''>like tc minus t to the minus 1/2 power. So the exponent mu of
  1/2 that we have been thinking</span> <span m=''4050560''>about is none other than
  the 1/2 that you have for random walks, once you realize that</span> <span m=''4058420''>what
  is going on is that the length of the paths that carry information essentially diverges</span>
  <span m=''4065779''>linearly on approaching this. So that''s one understanding.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4076560''>Now, you would say that this is the Gaussian picture.
  Now I know that when we calculated</span> <span m=''4085570''>things to order of
  epsilon, we found that mu was 1/2 plus something. It became larger.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4096839''>So what does that mean? Well, if you have these paths, and the paths
  cannot cross each</span> <span m=''4106509''>other-- it comes here, it has to go
  further away, because they are really non-phantom-- then</span> <span m=''4114988''>they
  will swell. So the exponent mu that you expect to get will be larger than 1/2. So</span>
  <span m=''4123120''>that''s what''s captured in here.</span> </p><p><span m=''4128520''>Well,
  how can I really try to capture that more mathematically? Well, I say that in the</span>
  <span m=''4136500''>calculations that I did-- let''s say when I was calculating
  the correlation functions</span> <span m=''4141149''>sigma 0 sigma r, in the approximation
  of phantomness, I included all paths that went from 0 to r.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4151160''>Among those there were paths that were crossing themselves. So I really
  have to subtract from</span> <span m=''4158309''>that a path that comes and crosses
  itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''4163719''>So I have to subtract that. I also had
  this condition that I had the numerator and denominator</span> <span m=''4172618''>that
  cancel each other, which really means that I have to subtract the possibility of</span>
  <span m=''4178229''>my path intersecting with another loop that is over here. And
  we can try to incorporate</span> <span m=''4189339''>these as corrections.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4193399''>But we''ve already done that, because if I Fourier transform
  this object, I saw that</span> <span m=''4199159''>it is this 1 over q squared plus
  k squared. And then we were calculating these u perturbative</span> <span m=''4207410''>corrections,
  and we had diagrams that kind of looked like this. Oops, I guess I want</span> <span
  m=''4214881''>to first draw the other diagram.</span> </p><p><span m=''4222480''>And
  then we had a diagram that was like this. You remember when we were doing these
  phi</span> <span m=''4230489''>to the 4th calculations, the corrections that we
  had for the propagator, which was related</span> <span m=''4236969''>to the two-point
  correlation function, were precisely these diagrams, where we were essentially</span>
  <span m=''4244050''>subtracting factors that were set by u. Of course, the value
  of u could be anything,</span> <span m=''4252250''>and you can see that there is
  really a one-to-one correspondence.</span> </p><p><span m=''4256900''>Any of the
  diagrams that you had before really captures the picture of one of these paths</span>
  <span m=''4264179''>trying to cross itself that you have to subtract. And you can
  sort of put a one-to-one mathematical</span> <span m=''4273420''>correspondence
  between what is going on here. Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m=''4275920''>AUDIENCE:
  So why can''t we have the path in the first correction you drew? Because aren''t</span>
  <span m=''4280300''>we allowed to have four bonds that attach to one site when we''re
  doing the original</span> <span m=''4285780''>expansion?</span> </p><p><span m=''4286960''>PROFESSOR:
  OK, so I told you at the beginning that you should keep track of all of my mistakes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4292719''>And that''s a very subtle thing. So what you are asking
  is, in the original Ising model,</span> <span m=''4299199''>I can draw perfectly
  OK a graph such as this that has an intersection such as this. As</span> <span m=''4307940''>we
  will show next time-- so bear with me-- in calculating things while in the phantom
  condition,</span> <span m=''4315019''>this is counted three times as much as it
  should. So I have to subtract that, because</span> <span m=''4322040''>a walk that
  comes here can either go forward, up, or down. There is some degeneracy there</span>
  <span m=''4328079''>that essentially, this has done an over-counting that is important,
  and I have to correct for</span> <span m=''4333820''>when I do things more carefully
  next time around. Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''4338140''>AUDIENCE: When you did
  the Gaussian model, we never had to put any sort of requirement</span> <span m=''4342559''>on
  the lattice being a square lattice.</span> </p><p><span m=''4344360''>PROFESSOR:
  No.</span> </p><p><span m=''4345340''>AUDIENCE: Didn''t we have to do that here
  when you did those random walks?</span> </p><p><span m=''4348690''>PROFESSOR: No,
  I only use the square condition or hypercube condition in order to be able</span>
  <span m=''4355820''>to write this in general dimension. I could very well have done
  triangular, FCC, or any</span> <span m=''4361440''>other lattice. The expression
  here would have been more complicated.</span> </p><p><span m=''4377480''>So finally,
  we can also ask, we have a feel from renormalization group, et cetera, that</span>
  <span m=''4392019''>the Gaussian exponents, like mu equals to 1/2, are, in fact,
  good provided that you</span> <span m=''4398940''>are in sufficiently high dimension--
  if you are above four dimensions. Where did you see</span> <span m=''4404749''>that
  occurring in this picture? The answer is as follows.</span> </p><p><span m=''4422019''>So
  basically, I have ignored the possibility of intersections. So let''s see when that
  condition</span> <span m=''4437170''>is roughly good. The kind of entities that
  I have as I get closer and closer to tc in</span> <span m=''4446559''>the phantom
  case are these random walks.</span> </p><p><span m=''4451519''>And we said that
  the characteristic of a random walk is that if I have something that carries</span>
  <span m=''4458050''>l steps, that the typical size in space that it will grow scales
  like l to the 1/2. So</span> <span m=''4475960''>we can recast this as a dimension.
  Basically, we are used to say linear objects having a</span> <span m=''4490070''>mass
  that grows-- what do I want to do?</span> </p><p><span m=''4500059''>Let''s say
  that I have a hypercube of size L. Let''s actually call it size R. Then the</span>
  <span m=''4519760''>mass of this, or the number of elements that constitute this
  object, grow like R to the</span> <span m=''4526260''>d.</span> </p><p><span m=''4531650''>So
  if I take my random walk, and think of it as something in which every step has unit</span>
  <span m=''4538710''>mass, you would say that the l is proportional to mass so that
  the radius grows like the</span> <span m=''4547429''>number of elements to the 1/2
  power or the mass of the 1/2 power. So you would say that</span> <span m=''4553620''>the
  random walk, if I want to force it in terms of a relationship between mass and radius,</span>
  <span m=''4562389''>that mass goes like radius squared. So in that sense, you can
  say that the random walk</span> <span m=''4574579''>has a fractal or Hausdorff dimension
  of 2.</span> </p><p><span m=''4588170''>So if you kind of are very, very blind,
  you would say that this is like a random walk.</span> </p><p><span m=''4598300''>It''s
  a two-dimensional thing. It''s a page.</span> </p><p><span m=''4602730''>So now
  the question is, if I have two geometrical entities, will they intersect? So if
  I have</span> <span m=''4614260''>a plane and a line in three dimensions, they will
  barely intersect. In four dimensions,</span> <span m=''4622540''>they won''t intersect.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''4625409''>If I have two surfaces that are two dimensional, in three
  dimensions, they intersect in a line.</span> </p><p><span m=''4633380''>In four
  dimensions, they would intersect in a point. And in five dimensions, they won''t</span>
  <span m=''4638619''>generically intersect, like two lines generically don''t intersect
  in three dimensions.</span> </p><p><span m=''4644579''>So if you ask, how bad is
  it that I ignored the intersection of objects that are inherently</span> <span m=''4655329''>random
  walking in sufficiently high dimensions, I would say the answer geometrically would</span>
  <span m=''4664239''>be in intersection is generic if d is less than 2 df, which
  is 4. So we made a very drastic</span> <span m=''4682090''>assumption. But as long
  as we are above four dimensions, it''s OK. There''s so much space</span> <span m=''4690050''>around
  that statistically, these intersections, this non-phantomness, is so entropically
  constraining</span> <span m=''4702280''>that it never happens.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4704100''>You can ignore it, and the results are OK. But you go to four dimensions
  and below, you</span> <span m=''4711969''>can''t ignore it, because generically,
  these things will intersect with each other. That''s</span> <span m=''4716681''>why
  these diagrams are going to blow up on you, and give you some important contribution</span>
  <span m=''4722699''>that would swell, and give you a value of mu that is larger
  than the 1/2 that we have</span> <span m=''4727829''>for random walks.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''4732739''>So that''s the essence of where the Gaussian model was, why we get
  mu equals to 1/2, why</span> <span m=''4740630''>we get mu''s that are larger than
  1/2, what the meaning of these diagrams is, what four</span> <span m=''4746159''>dimensions
  is special. All of it really just comes down to central limit theorem and knowing</span>
  <span m=''4752739''>that the sum of a large number of variables that has a square
  root of n type of variance</span> <span m=''4758570''>and fluctuations. And it''s
  all captured by that.</span> </p><p><span m=''4763579''>But we wanted to really
  solve the model exactly. It turns out that we can make the conditions</span> <span
  m=''4774789''>that were very hard to implement in general dimensions to work out
  correctly in two dimensions.</span> </p><p><span m=''4783329''>And so the next lecture
  will show you what these mistakes are, how to avoid them, and</span> <span m=''4790050''>how
  to get the exact value of this sum in two dimensions.</span> </p>'
